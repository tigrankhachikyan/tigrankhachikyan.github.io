# PostgreSQL: Reclaiming Space - TRUNCATE vs VACUUM FULL

## The Problem
Large tables accumulate dead tuples and bloat over time, wasting disk space. Two commands can reclaim this space: `TRUNCATE` and `VACUUM FULL`.

## TRUNCATE: Fast but Destructive

**What it does:**
- Removes **ALL data** from the table instantly
- Resets auto-increment sequences
- Removes all rows, indexes, and constraints remain intact
- Releases disk space immediately back to the OS

**Syntax:**
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name RESTART IDENTITY;  -- Reset sequences
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name CASCADE;            -- Truncate related tables
```

**Key characteristics:**
- ‚ö° **Extremely fast** - doesn't scan the table
- üîí **Requires ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock** (blocks all operations)
- üóëÔ∏è **Data loss** - all rows are permanently deleted
- üíæ **Immediate space reclaim** - disk space freed instantly
- ‚èÆÔ∏è **Not MVCC-safe** - cannot be rolled back easily

**Use when:**
- You don't need the data anymore
- Clearing staging/temporary tables
- Resetting test environments

## VACUUM FULL: Slow but Safe

**What it does:**
- Compacts the table by rewriting it entirely
- Removes dead tuples and reclaims space
- **Preserves all data** - only removes bloat
- Returns freed space to the OS

**Syntax:**
```sql
VACUUM FULL table_name;
VACUUM FULL VERBOSE table_name;  -- Show progress
```

**Key characteristics:**
- üêå **Very slow** - rewrites entire table
- üîí **Requires ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock** (blocks reads and writes)
- ‚úÖ **Data preserved** - only removes dead space
- üíæ **Space reclaimed** - but needs 2x space during operation
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Long downtime** on large tables

**Use when:**
- Table has significant bloat but you need the data
- During maintenance windows
- After large DELETE/UPDATE operations

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | TRUNCATE | VACUUM FULL |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Instant | Very slow |
| **Data** | Deleted | Preserved |
| **Lock** | ACCESS EXCLUSIVE | ACCESS EXCLUSIVE |
| **Space freed** | Immediate | After completion |
| **Disk space needed** | None extra | 2x table size |
| **Use case** | Don't need data | Need data, remove bloat |

## Understanding ACCESS EXCLUSIVE Locks

Both `TRUNCATE` and `VACUUM FULL` require an **ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock** - the most restrictive lock in PostgreSQL.

**What this means:**
- üö´ **No reads allowed** - even `SELECT` queries are blocked
- üö´ **No writes allowed** - `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` are blocked
- üö´ **No concurrent operations** - indexes, constraints, everything waits
- ‚è≥ **Lock wait time** - command waits if table is currently in use
- üîÑ **Query queuing** - all other queries queue behind the lock

**Real-world impact:**
```sql
-- Session 1: Long-running query
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE date > '2024-01-01';  -- Takes 30 seconds

-- Session 2: Tries to truncate
TRUNCATE TABLE orders;  -- Waits for Session 1 to finish

-- Session 3: Simple query
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;  -- Also waits! Blocked by Session 2's lock request
```

**Lock behavior differences:**

| Operation | Lock Type | Blocks Reads? | Blocks Writes? |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| `SELECT` | ACCESS SHARE | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| `UPDATE/DELETE` | ROW EXCLUSIVE | ‚ùå No | ‚ö†Ô∏è Conflicting rows |
| `VACUUM` (regular) | SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| `VACUUM FULL` | ACCESS EXCLUSIVE | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `TRUNCATE` | ACCESS EXCLUSIVE | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Avoiding lock issues:**

```sql
-- Set a lock timeout to avoid waiting forever
SET lock_timeout = '5s';
VACUUM FULL orders;
-- If can't acquire lock in 5 seconds, it fails instead of waiting

-- Check for blocking queries before maintenance
SELECT pid, query, state, wait_event_type
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = 'your_database' 
  AND state = 'active';

-- Kill blocking query if necessary (use carefully!)
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Lock duration matters:**
- `TRUNCATE`: Lock held for milliseconds (very fast)
- `VACUUM FULL`: Lock held for minutes to hours (depends on table size)

‚ö†Ô∏è **VACUUM FULL is rarely recommended** - consider alternatives:
- Regular `VACUUM` (only SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock - non-blocking)
- `pg_repack` (online table rewrite, minimal locking)
- Partitioning strategies

‚ö†Ô∏è **TRUNCATE removes:**
- All rows
- Resets sequences (with RESTART IDENTITY)
- Triggers TRUNCATE triggers (if defined)

## Best Practices

**For development/testing:**
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE staging_data;
```

**For production bloat:**
```sql
-- During maintenance window
VACUUM FULL VERBOSE production_table;

-- Or better: use pg_repack (no exclusive lock)
pg_repack -t production_table -d database_name
```

**Check table bloat before deciding:**
```sql
SELECT 
    schemaname, tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) - pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS bloat
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'your_table';
```

## TL;DR

- **TRUNCATE** = Delete everything, get space back instantly (use for temp data)
- **VACUUM FULL** = Keep data, remove bloat slowly (use during maintenance)
- **Both lock the table** - plan for downtime
- **Consider alternatives** like `pg_repack` for production systems
